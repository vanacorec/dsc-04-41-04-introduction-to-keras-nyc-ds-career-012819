    "Thus far we have a solid basic conceptual understanding of neural networks and their basic architecture. We've seen nueral networks for classification including a neural network with no hidden layers (logistic regression), one hidden layer, and several hidden layers. From here, we'll begin to use Keras, a package that has prebuilt many of the building blocks of neural networks which we investigated in previous lessons.  \n",

    "* A batch generally approximates the distribution of the input data better than a single input. The larger the batch, the better the approximation; however, it is also true that the batch will take longer to process and will still result in only one update. For inference (evaluate/predict), it is recommended to pick a batch size that is as large as you can afford without going out of memory (since larger batches will usually result in faster evaluation/prediction).\n",

    "* When using validation_data or validation_split with the fit method of Keras models, evaluation will be run at the end of every epoch.\n",
